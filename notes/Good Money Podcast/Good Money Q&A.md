Question: Having a lot savings in a country where there is corruption and inflation?

"Get the money out of the savings account and into some real goods, the Man wants you to have all of your money in a place where it can be cut in half. If you can buy real-estate then do it. If you have a reason to save for a particular act then save but if not then spend it now on those souls over whom you have care. One of the ways of keeping Christian power supressed throughout the world is by having Christians integrated into a money economy where all of their labour and work are summarised and limited by cash, which we put into bank accounts which then devalues. Christian power is given over to states and banks for their own ends. Let me turn my real work into goods that can be used by people now rather than use money as a long term middle man, if you can put it into good works within your community as immediately as possible not just in investements but in good will, friendships, family and community through the virtuous use of that money."
