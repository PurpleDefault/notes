8 Rules of Marketing

1. Be the best listener you ever met - listen to what the market is saying.
2. Work extremely intensely, in spurts - focus your energy on one. Do not multitask.
3. Never "create", know the products strengths and present them.
4. Write to the chimpanzee brain - simple and direct language.
5. Channel demand, never sell - find an existing demand and channel that demand to your products.
6. Think about what your product "does" not what the product "is".
7. Make gratification instantaneous - in the marketing or copy the prospect should already be feeling a sense of gratification.
8. Failing often, testing big differences, shows you are trying hard enough.

**Lecture Notes

- Work in short bursts - Focus on one task at a time, make use of the Pomodoro Method, 25 minutes work, 5 minutes break. Focus intensely for a short time, rest and move away from what you're working on during the rest break. *Do not multitask.*
- Always be listening - Be the best listener you know. Customers, clients, prospects will tell you everything you need to know about themselves, their business, their needs. Let them talk, get them talking.
- Don't give the finished product away right away - This will lead the client, customer or prospect to undervalue your work and lead them to assume it isn't worth what you are asking. Even if it takes a few hours to deliver for a two week deadline, let it sit for two weeks then deliver it.
- Let ideas come to you - Let your unconscious mind do the heavy lifting. Don't rely on your own creativity to come up with new ideas. Let others come up with the ideas. Always listen to what people are saying. Combine things together to create new things.
- Success in any endeavour - Work, work, work, work and more work.
- Work in half-hour sprints. 25 minutes on, 5 minutes off. 30 on, 10 off. Focus and energy is limited and will be exhausted after a short time of effort. Rest often.
- Creativity does not exist within you - you cannot create "Ex Nihilo", from nothing. Let other people tell you the ideas. Listen.
- Dig creativity out of your market - Search, dig and find creative ideas from your market and competitors. Dig more than others and you will be better than they are and succeed more.
- Use a timer - Using a timer will dissolve all willpower needs for the work you need to do. Pomodoro Method. 25 on, 5 off.
- No goal, no responsibility, no obligation - Just work, work, work.
- Connectivity not creation - connect ideas together that have never been connected before. Creating something new is not about creating something completely new, it is about connecting things together that have never been connected before.
- *New doesn't mean "never existed" it means "never connected before"*
- Creativity exists in the subconscious mind - Do not rely on your conscious mind for creativity. Let your subconscious do the work.
- You have to prepare - read everything.
- Go over things over and over and over again - always read and reread.
- Work harder than everyone else and you will succeed.
- Read everything, even things you don't want to read - low culture (fashion magazines, sports mags), this is where the most money is.
- Assume people are good - People want to be good, seen to be good and want to do good.
- Learn to listen - This skill will pay dividends. Look out for specific things, let people talk and they will tell you everything you need to know about them and their desires. Let them talk.
- People become hypnotised by their own stories - Let people talk and listen for specific things.
- Use simple and vivid words - Write for the chimpanzee brain. Simple, direct, emotional, vivid.
- Copywriting is simple and effective writing - keep the words and language simple, direct and vivid.
- Everything is copy - Everything you write, speak and do can be related to copy. You are always trying to convince, argue, sell, manipulate etc.
- Simple, direct, gut writing.
- The headline is not meant to sell - The purpose of the headline is to get the reader to **stop** and read the next line. *Not to sell.* The next paragraph is meant to get the reader to read the next paragraph and so on. Headline does not need to sell anything.
- You are writing not to individuals but a group of people - These people all have private wants that you can fulfil, these people are all that matter. They can have sub-wants that can be fulfilled.
- The most powerful word in advertising is **you** not **free**. Make things personal, like you are writing to that one specific person.
- Deep emotion - Adjectives carry and create emotion, gut words, description words, feeling words.
- Biography - this builds trust. People love biographies.
- The ad is built as a mosaic - every word is a branch of a tree, it's all connected.
- You cannot create demand, only find it and channel it to you products.
- The only way to measure results is to test. Past experience isn't a guarantee of future performance or success.
- Freshness - Look different than your competitors. If everyone looks good then everyone looks the same. Look different, freshness.
- Focus on what your product "does" not what it "is".
